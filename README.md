# Advanced-SQL-Lab-Final-Project

This project involves implementing a comprehensive database management system with a GUI interface as part of an Advanced Database Systems Laboratory course.
The GUI was done in C#, DB management was done using MSSQL.

## Key Components:

- **GUI Interface:** Developed using C# Windows Forms for user interaction.
- **Database Management:** Implemented using Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL).
- **User Management System:** Includes three user types - System Administrator, Registered User, and Guest.
- **Database Features:** Incorporates complex queries, views, triggers, stored procedures, and transactions.

## System Architecture

- Manages user authentication, data operations, and system functionalities.
- Reads and writes data to/from the MSSQL database.
- Handles different user permissions and access levels.

## System Flow

- Users log in based on their role (Admin, Registered, Guest).
- Different functionalities are available based on user permissions.
- System performs various database operations including complex queries and transactions.
- Includes backup and restoration procedures for data safety.

## Technical Features:

- Complex and nested SQL queries involving multiple tables
- Temporary tables for optimized data processing
- Database views for simplified data access
- Triggers and stored procedures for automated operations
- Transaction management for data integrity
- User authentication and authorization system
- Backup and restoration capabilities
